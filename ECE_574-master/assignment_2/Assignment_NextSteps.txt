1. Init() (Started by Sai and Chris)
   1. Create empty .v file
   2. Open netlist.txt
   3. Call parse()
1. Parsing elements (inputs,outputs,reg, etc.) (Try to have simple working code by 10/26 - Spearheaded by John)
   1. A vector of “signal” class type. It stores
      1. Signal type (inout, output, reg, etc)
      2. Data type (signed, unsigned)
      3. Data width (int8, int16, etc)
      4. Signal name (“a” for example)
1. If no more elements, parse component instantiations (Try to have pseudo code by 10/26 - Spearheaded by all but John)
   1. Identify if elements are valid (in d = a / b, does d exist?, etc)
   2. Identify the operation
   3. Identify the operands
   4. Identify data width matching 
      1. Truncate, pad
   1. Identify paths (574a)
      1. Critical path calculated as we go? 
   1. Form the final string (the actual call in verilog: <SDIV>(a,b,d))
1. Generate the .v (Needs previous steps completed and working)
